-- This query consolidates Facebook Ads data from various tables
-- to provide a comprehensive view of ad, ad set, and campaign performance,
-- including daily and lifetime metrics, and historical metadata.

-- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for deduplicating historical data
-- These CTEs ensure that only the most recent record for each ID
-- from the history tables is used, based on 'updated_time' and '_fivetran_synced'.
