### Added
- **24-hour agent-log signal capture**
  What: added parsing of recent Codex session logs to capture terminal commands (`exec_command`), user/assistant messages, and path clues for ranking context.
  Why: improve detection of what you are actively doing right now, even when VS Code tabs are unavailable.

  </details>

### Changed
- **Workstream ranking signal priorities**
  What: rebalanced scoring to prioritize recent file edits, terminal command history, message history, and git activity, while reducing open-tab influence to a supplemental signal.
  Why: reduce false top-task ranking and better match active work from the last 24 hours.

  </details>

- **Run interface and docs for log window control**
  What: added `--log-window-hours` (default `24`) and updated skill documentation to reflect the new log-driven ranking behavior.
  Why: keep behavior explicit and make the time window easy to tune while preserving a sensible default.

## 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Explicit snapshot provenance in each entry**
  What: added per-entry source lines that explicitly state the Codex skill and automation source.
  Why: make daily snapshots auditable and unambiguous about origin.
  <details><summary>Paths — Explicit snapshot provenance in each entry</summary>

  [/Users/eugenetsenter/Looker_clonedRepo/looker_personal/current-work-skill/scripts/generate_current_work.py](/Users/eugenetsenter/Looker_clonedRepo/looker_personal/current-work-skill/scripts/generate_current_work.py)

  </details>

### Changed
- **Snapshot source block in workspace/global outputs**
  What: added a top-level `Snapshot Source` block to generated workspace/global docs and included matching metadata in run artifacts.
  Why: keep report-level provenance visible without opening metadata files.
  <details><summary>Paths — Snapshot source block in workspace/global outputs</summary>

  </details>

- **Global output destination for vault root**
  What: updated run documentation to use the Obsidian vault root current-work file as the global destination.
  Why: align default operator workflow with the requested daily target location.
  <details><summary>Paths — Global output destination for vault root</summary>

  [/Users/eugenetsenter/Looker_clonedRepo/looker_personal/current-work-skill/README.md](/Users/eugenetsenter/Looker_clonedRepo/looker_personal/current-work-skill/README.md)

  </details>

### Fixed
- **Redundant provenance fields in snapshot output**
  Issue: visible snapshot output repeated source metadata and included thread identifiers that added clutter.
  Cause: provenance renderer and entry-source formatter carried full thread metadata into all sections.
  Resolution: reduced rendered provenance to compact skill + automation fields and removed thread details from visible output.

### Added
- **Versioned retry artifact bundle**
  What: saved baseline plus three improvement rounds and a best-version rerun in a single scrap run folder.
  Why: keep every iteration visible so quality changes are easy to audit and compare.

- **Comparison report set**
  What: added round-by-round improvement notes (5 improvements per round) and a final best-version decision document.
  Why: make it clear what changed, why it changed, and which version should be used.

### Changed
- **Resume-first output behavior**
  What: improved generated output to prioritize `Headlines`, include `Do First`, rank workstreams by evidence, and show confidence, priority reason, effort estimate, and scope note.
  Why: reduce restart friction and make the next action obvious within seconds.

  </details>

- **Action guidance and clickable path navigation**
  What: removed the `Where I Looked This Run` section from main docs, added `How to do this` guidance under each next step, and made path entries clickable.
  Why: keep the report focused on fast restart and reduce friction when opening relevant files.

- **Source transparency and non-interactive note capture**
  What: each run now records where sources were scanned and writes a non-interactive note for long-term recall.
  Why: improve trust in the snapshot and keep context recoverable later.
